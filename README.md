## Learning Java from the head first book  

Each chapter is a branch, with c1 -chapter 1 etc.  

To install the jdk use the following:  
`apt-get install default-jdk`  

To compile:  
`javac MyFile.java`  

To run:  
`java MyFile`  

### Chapter 2  

-  Look for features that all classes have in common and *abstract* these out to
  a new class.  
-  Parent class is called the *superclass* and children are *subclasses*  
-  If you need specilised behaviour in a function you can *override* the method
   in question.  
-  Things that an object *knows* are *instance variable*, which repressent the
   objects *state*.   
-  Things that an object *does* are *methods*.  
-  A *class* is a blueprint for an *object*. 

#### Creating objects

-  Use the syntax `Dog d = new Dog();` to create a Dog instance.  
-  You can access the instance variable using the dot `d.size = 40`.
